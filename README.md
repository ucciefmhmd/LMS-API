LMS API
Overview
The LMS API is a RESTful web service designed to facilitate the management of a Learning Management System (LMS). It provides endpoints for user authentication, authorization using JWT bearer tokens, and CRUD operations for managing various entities within the LMS such as users (admin, subadmin, student, instructor), subjects (courses, exams, events), etc.

Features
Authentication and Authorization: Users are authenticated and authorized using JWT bearer tokens, ensuring secure access to LMS resources.
User Management: Allows CRUD operations for managing users with different roles including admin, subadmin, student, and instructor.
Subject Management: Provides functionalities to create, read, update, and delete subjects such as courses, exams, and events.
Role-Based Access Control: Implements role-based access control to restrict access to certain endpoints and functionalities based on user roles.
Comprehensive CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing LMS entities.
Flexible and Extensible: Designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing easy integration with other systems and future expansion of functionalities.
Entities
User: Represents a user of the LMS system. Users can have different roles such as admin, subadmin, student, or instructor.
Course: Represents a course offered within the LMS.
Exam: Represents an exam or assessment within the LMS.
Event: Represents an event or activity within the LMS.

Authentication Flow
User logs in via the /auth/login endpoint with valid credentials.
Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT bearer token and returns it to the client.
The client includes the JWT bearer token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to authenticate and access protected endpoints.
The server verifies the JWT bearer token and grants access to authorized endpoints based on the user's role and permissions.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies.
Configure environment variables for database connection and JWT secret key.
Run the server.
Access the API endpoints using a REST client or integrate with a front-end application.
Dependencies
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing LMS data.
JWT: JSON Web Token for authentication and authorization.
Conclusion
The LMS API provides a robust backend solution for managing a Learning Management System. With its comprehensive set of endpoints and features, it offers flexibility, security, and scalability, making it suitable for various educational institutions and organizations.
